# ggl : common internet searches from the command line

This is another life-changing python script to automate a process which will prolly save your 5-10 seconds of your time. Of course, you as a programmer need this kinda productivity. You don't need to thank me. If you really insist, I won't mind tho.

- google (even with a specific Google Chrome profile: if you're using Google Chrome)
- browse chrome in incognito mode 
- google images and videos
- search with duckduckgo
- github repos, stack overflow discussions
- search youtube
- wikipedia pages
- search your gmail inbox
- prompt chatgpt, gemini
- prompt to send emails (texts only) to someone from the terminal (using gmail)

# Usage

```
ggl [-p profile] [--incog] [options] <query|prompt>
ggl [--mail|--send-mail] <receiver's address> [--sub|--subject] [text]

options:
   -h --help                         display this help page
   -im --img                         show the image section for the search
   -v --vid                          show the video section from the search
   -y -yt                            search the youtube

   -gm --gmail                       search your mail with that search-query
   --mail --send-mail                prompt to send mail to someone with their mail address
   --sub --subject                   option for --mail --send-mail flag to add a subject (optional)

Only for Google Chrome
   -i --incog                        open Google Chrome in incognito mode
   -p                                set a specific chrome profile for searching
   -l --list                         list all the chrome profiles


EXAMPLES:

ggl why programmers hate everyone
ggl "What's the capital of Russia"
ggl 'What does the word "retarded" mean'
ggl -yt stuxnet documentary
ggl --img a flycatcher
ggl --vid how to learn to code
ggl -w computer science terminologies
ggl --git taraqfarhan/ggl
ggl --stack "what language is used to write unix commands"
ggl --ddg why duckduckgo is better than google
ggl --gpt why we should even bother about the command line interface

Mail (gmail)
ggl --gmail contract proposal
ggl --send-mail taraqfarhan@gmail.com send me the docs asap
ggl --mail taraqfarhan@gmail.com --sub "Assignment Submission" submit your assignment by tomorrow

Specific to Google Chrome only
ggl -p 3 --img chess board
ggl -p business -yt How does money work?
ggl -p guest how to use the dark web

# How to use this script on your own machine

I will recommend you to use ```Google Chrome``` on your machine as your default browser to get the most out of this tool. If Google Chrome is installed on your machine, ```ggl``` will use Google Chrome for browsing, otherwise ```ggl``` will use your Default Browser.

Anyway, to use this script just clone this repo using 
```bash
git clone https://www.github.com/taraqfarhan/ggl
``` 
Then run this python script. Ofc you'll need ```python3``` installed on your machine first to run a python script duh! 

# Homebrew installation (for macOS/linux) (coming soon)

```ggl``` will be added to ```Homebrew``` soon. Then, for ```macOS``` and ```linux``` you can install ```ggl``` using

```bash
brew install ggl
```

# To use a python script globally (RECOMMENDED)
> THIS SECTION IS FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO RUN IT GLOBALLY, ANYWHERE FROM THE TERMINAL. OTHERWISE, YOU'LL HAVE TO EXPLICITLY SPECIFY THE PATH OF THE SCRIPT EACH TIME
```bash
python3 path/to/the/ggl/script
```

To use a Python script globally (i.e., you can execute it from anywhere in the terminal) on ```Windows```, ```macOS```, and ```Linux```, you need to ensure the script is accessible from your system's PATH and possibly make it executable.

### **Step 1: Place Your Script in a Directory**
Move the script (`ggl`) to a directory accessible to the PATH. Common locations:
- **macOS/Linux**: Use `/usr/local/bin`, `~/bin`, or another directory in your PATH.
- **Windows**: A folder like `C:\Scripts` or a directory already in the PATH (e.g., `C:\Python\Scripts`).

To create a new directory for scripts:
For macOS/linux:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/bin
```

For Windows, manually create a folder, e.g., `C:\Scripts`.

### **Step 2: Add the Script Directory to PATH**
If the directory containing your script is not already in the PATH, you need to add it.

#### **mac/linux**
1. Edit your shell configuration file:
   - For **bash**: `~/.bashrc`
   - For **zsh**: `~/.zshrc`

2. Add the following line:
   ```bash
   export PATH="$PATH:~/bin"
   ```

3. Save the file and reload it:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc (for bash)
   source ~/.zshrc (for zsh)
   ```

#### **Windows**
1. Open **Environment Variables**:
   - Press `Win + S`, search for **Environment Variables**, and click **Edit the system environment variables**.
   - In the **System Properties** window, click **Environment Variables**.

2. Add the Directory to PATH:
   - Under **System Variables** or **User Variables**, find `Path` and click **Edit**.
   - Add your directory (e.g., `C:\Scripts`).

3. Save and restart your terminal.


### **Step 3: Make the Script Executable**
#### **linux/mac**
Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x ~/bin/ggl
   ```

#### **Windows**
No need to make the script executable explicitly. 
But You might need to rename the script from ggl to ggl.py (if needed). Check the following steps to learn more.

### **Step 4: Testing**
Run the script in a terminal to verify it works globally.

Open a new terminal and type:
   ```bash
   ggl -h
   ```

# Configuration (for Google Chrome profiles)

> IF AND ONLY IF YOU WANT TO USE (flags that are specific to Google Chrome only), YOU NEED TO CONFIGURE THE config.json FILE, OTHERWISE YOU'RE GOOD TO GO. YOU DON'T NEED ANY CONFIGURATIONS (YOU CAN SKIP THIS SECTION COMPLETELY)
> YOU SHOULD CONFIGURE THE 'config.json' FILE PROPERY TO USE THIS SCRIPT IN ANY OPERATING SYSTEM. OTHERWISE YOU MIGHT GET UNEXPECTED ERROR MESSAGES.

A **config.json** file will be created automatically if you run this scipt for the first time. You will find that configuration file in:

```
1. macOS/linux: ~/.config/ggl/config.json
2. Windows: %APPDATA%\ggl\config.json
```

Now, you need to configure this **config.json** file.

1. Set the values (your own customized value) of the keys (Chrome Profiles) according to your own needs.
2. (if needed) Then set the Google Chrome's path. Check the path for Google Chrome on your computer and set the path to the **config.json** file if needed.

### How to Find Your Google Chrome Profile Names

Locate Chromeâ€™s User Data Directory:

```
1. macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/
2. Linux: ~/.config/google-chrome/
3. Windows: C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\
```

Inspect the Directory. Match the folder name with the corresponding Chrome profile.

```
1. Default: The main profile.
2. Profile 1, Profile 2, etc.: Additional profiles.
```
