> THIS SCRIPT IS INITIALLY WRITTEN FOR MACOS, YOU SHOULD CONFIGURE THE 'config.json' FILE PROPERY, OTHERWISE YOU MIGHT GET UNEXPECTED ERROR MESSAGES

## How to Find Your Google Chrome Profile Names

Locate Chromeâ€™s User Data Directory:
```
1. **macOS**: ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/
2. **Linux**: ~/.config/google-chrome/
3. **Windows**: C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\
```

Inspect the Directory. Match the folder name with the corresponding Chrome profile.
```
1. **Default**: The main profile.
2. **Profile 1, Profile 2, etc.**: Additional profiles.
```
