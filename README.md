# ggl : Search the web from the terminal (and much more)

This is another life-changing python script to automate a process which will prolly save your 5-10 seconds of your time. Of course, you as a programmer need this kinda productivity. You don't need to thank me. If you really insist, I won't mind tho.

You can search :

- google stuffs (even with a specific Google Chrome profile: if you're using Google Chrome)
- google images and videos
- browse chrome in incognito mode (if you're using chrome)
- youtube
- github, stack overflow
- wikipedia
- duckduckgo
- gmail

And you can also :

- prompt chatgpt, gemini
- prompt to send emails (texts only) to someone from the terminal (using gmail)

# How to use this script on your own machine

I will recommend you to use ```Google Chrome``` on your machine as your default browser to get the most out of this tool. If Google Chrome is installed on your machine, ```ggl``` will use Google Chrome for browsing, otherwise ```ggl``` will use your Default Browser.

Anyway, to use this script Just clone this repo using 
```bash
git clone https://www.github.com/taraqfarhan/ggl
``` 
Then run this python script. Ofc you'll need ```python3``` installed on your machine first to run a python script duh! 

# Homebrew installation (for macOS/linux) (coming soon)

```ggl``` will be added to ```Homebrew``` soon. Then, for ```macOS``` and ```linux``` you can install ```ggl``` using

```bash
brew install ggl
```

# To use a python script globally (RECOMMENDED)
> THIS SECTION IS FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO RUN IT GLOBALLY FROM THE TERMINAL. OTHERWISE, YOU'LL HAVE TO EXPLICITLY SPECIFY THE PATH OF THE SCRIPT EACH TIME
```bash
python3 path/to/the/ggl/script (for macOS/linux)
python path/to/the/ggl/script (windows)
```

To use a Python script globally (i.e., you can execute it from anywhere in the terminal) on ```Windows```, ```macOS```, and ```Linux```, you need to ensure the script is accessible from your system's PATH and possibly make it executable.

### **Step 1: Place Your Script in a Directory**
Move the script (`ggl`) to a directory accessible to the PATH. Common locations:
- **macOS/Linux**: Use `/usr/local/bin`, `~/bin`, or another directory in your PATH.
- **Windows**: A folder like `C:\Scripts` or a directory already in the PATH (e.g., `C:\Python\Scripts`).

To create a new directory for scripts:
For macOS/linux:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/bin
```

For Windows, manually create a folder, e.g., `C:\Scripts`.


### **Step 2: Add the Script Directory to PATH**
If the directory containing your script is not already in the PATH, you need to add it.

#### **macOS/Linux**
1. Edit your shell configuration file:
   - For **bash**: `~/.bashrc`
   - For **zsh**: `~/.zshrc`
   - For **fish**: `~/.config/fish/config.fish`

2. Add the following line:
   ```bash
   export PATH="$PATH:~/bin"
   ```

3. Save the file and reload it:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc (for bash)
   source ~/.zshrc (for zsh)
   source ~/.config/fish/config.fish (for fish)
   ```

#### **Windows**
1. Open **Environment Variables**:
   - Press `Win + S`, search for **Environment Variables**, and click **Edit the system environment variables**.
   - In the **System Properties** window, click **Environment Variables**.

2. Add the Directory to PATH:
   - Under **System Variables** or **User Variables**, find `Path` and click **Edit**.
   - Add your directory (e.g., `C:\Scripts`).

3. Save and restart your terminal.


### **Step 3: Make the Script Executable** (if needed)
#### **Linux/macOS**
Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x ~/bin/ggl
   ```

#### **Windows**
No need to make the script executable explicitly. 
But You might need to rename the script from ggl to ggl.py (if needed). Check the following steps to learn more.

### **Step 4: Testing**
Run the script in a terminal to verify it works globally.

**macOS/Linux**:
Open a new terminal and type:
   ```bash
   ggl 
   ```
**windows**:
Open Command Prompt or Windows Powershell and try 
   ```cmd
   ggl
   ggl.py
   python ggl
   python ggl.py
   python replace/this/with/your/path/to/ggl
   ```
  

# Configuration (for a specific Google Chrome profile)

> IF AND ONLY IF YOU WANT TO USE (flags that are specific to Google Chrome only), YOU NEED TO CONFIGURE THE config.json FILE, OTHERWISE YOU'RE GOOD TO GO. YOU DON'T NEED ANY CONFIGURATIONS (YOU CAN SKIP THIS SECTION COMPLETELY)
> YOU SHOULD CONFIGURE THE 'config.json' FILE PROPERY TO USE THIS SCRIPT IN ANY OPERATING SYSTEM. OTHERWISE YOU MIGHT GET UNEXPECTED ERROR MESSAGES.

A **config.json** file will be created automatically if you run this scipt for the first time. You will find that configuration file in:

```
1. macOS/linux: ~/.config/ggl/config.json
2. Windows: %APPDATA%\ggl\config.json
```

Now, you need to configure this **config.json** file.

1. Set the values (your own customized value) of the keys (Chrome Profiles) according to your own needs.
2. (if needed) Then set the Google Chrome's path. Check the path for Google Chrome on your computer and set the path to the **config.json** file if needed.

### How to Find Your Google Chrome Profile Names

Locate Chromeâ€™s User Data Directory:

```
1. macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/
2. Linux: ~/.config/google-chrome/
3. Windows: C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\
```

Inspect the Directory. Match the folder name with the corresponding Chrome profile.

```
1. Default: The main profile.
2. Profile 1, Profile 2, etc.: Additional profiles.
```
